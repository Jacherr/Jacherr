I'm a passionate software engineer with a particular interest in the fields of networking, parallelisation, optimisation, and low-level interfaces. I take a very hands-on approach to development and I'm always learning.

I graduated from Aberystwyth University with a BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree, and have worked at [Cisco](https://cisco.com) as part of their CX team, delivering testing environments to customers in order to facilitate benchmarking and stress-testing of networking solutions.

My main personal project is the [Assyst Discord bot](https://github.com/jacherr/assyst2), which has scaled to millions of users across more than 130 thousand Discord servers. Other projects include [Flux](https://github.com/jacherr/flux) - an image processing tool, and contributing to Rust's linter, [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy).

If you would like to contact me, you can email me via jacherrr@gmail.com, or send me a message on Discord. My username there is `jacher`.
